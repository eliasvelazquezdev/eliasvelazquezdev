<h1 align="center">Hey there! üëã, I'm Elias Velazquez</h1>

<p align="left">Hello there! If you're reading this, you must be a cool person curious about who I am, right? Let me introduce myself! I'm a Junior Data Engineer (among other things) based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and logical problem-solving, all focused on delivering tangible results. I have a deep appreciation for the terminal‚Äîit‚Äôs like my happy place‚Äîso you‚Äôll often find me working away on my trusty Linux machine. I‚Äôm proficient in Python, SQL, Pandas, and Git, and I love diving into the AWS ecosystem. Services like Lambda, EC2, ECR, and API Gateway are my playground for building solutions and solving problems.</p>
<p align="left">Details matter to me, especially when it comes to understanding client requirements. Clear communication and aligning expectations are key to delivering the right solution through code. I also value team collaboration, keeping my colleagues informed about my progress and seeking help when needed. I believe in striking a balance: solving problems independently but knowing when to reach out.</p>
<p align="left">I enjoy meeting new people and working together to create something great. As of February 2024, I‚Äôm working at a startup with global clients, communicating with them in English across both written and spoken channels.</p>
<p align="left">Outside the world of tech, I love playing keyboards (the musical kind‚Äîpun intended!), getting lost in a good book, enjoying a movie, or unwinding with video games like Mortal Kombat, Fallout, or STALKER (yes, pun *still* intended!).</p>
